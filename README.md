# RoofNut
 **Version: 1.12**
 
 <small>RoofNut is a simple GUI framework that was built as a school project.
</small>

 <small>RoofNut was heavily inspired by Walnut GUI framework for C++.
 We aim to be the best C GUI framework out there!</small>

# How does it work?
<small> RoofNut uses GLFW and Vulkan to draw a window, you can find this code in the application.c file.
Nuklear is already installed and implemented with the library, you can write your Nuklear code if you call the OnGuiRender() function.
For a more in depth guide, please see the "example.c" file.
 
# 3d party librarys:
Nuklear, GLFW and Vulkan.
